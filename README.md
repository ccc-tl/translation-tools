translation-tools
-----------------

This repository contains source code of the tools used to make the English translation patch for
Fate/Extra CCC as well as the Perfect Patch for Fate/Extra. The script editor GUI tool and its
backend server code are not included here.

This code has accumulated over 7 years of research and development. Over the years my skills and
understanding of the game changed and this can be seen in the code structure and quality.
This also means that setup is pretty complicated as various parts were added over the years.
The tools are not packaged into a single application, instead they are intended to be run directly
from the IDE. Don't be afraid to jump into the source code and make any changes as necessary.

The code here has already done its job so any pull requests are unnecessary.

This repository is licensed under the GPLv3 license, this license only applies to files in this
repository and not to any other patch components or resources.

Getting started guide for setting up CCC tools is available [here](https://github.com/ccc-tl/translation-tools/wiki/Getting-started-(CCC)).
